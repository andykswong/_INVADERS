## Gameplay
- Defeat endless waves of monsters in a confined space.
- Familiar gameplay elements from Space Invaders:
  - Start with 3 lives (5 for beginner mode)
  - No timer, but the game ends immediately if the monsters reach the space behind you.
  - The space between you and the monsters are reduced for each new wave
  - Flier class monsters behave the same as aliens in Space Invaders (see below).
- 3 types of monsters:
  - Flier class: Move left and right as a group, shifting forward when reaching the edge. Red-eyed ones shoot projectiles.
  - Walker class: Only move forward. Red-eyed ones shoot projectiles.
  - Laser class: Do not move, but shoot fast-moving blue projectiles.
- Beginner mode gives you extra lives in the first few waves and introduce you the different monster types one at a time. It is enabled by default for your first play.
- Mini-boss encounter (with 4 variations) on every 4th wave. You get 2 extra lifes when completing the wave:

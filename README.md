# _INVADERS

> Submission for [JS13kGames 2021](http://js13kgames.com/).

`_INVADERS` is Space Invaders-inspired game in 3D, in which you must stop endless waves of outer space monsters from invading Earth.

## Gameplay
- Defeat endless waves of monsters in a confined space.
- Start with 3 lifes (dots on the top-left of the screen), but similar to Space Invaders, the game ends immediately if the monsters reach the space behind you.
- 3 types of monsters:
  - Flier class: Same as aliens in Space Invaders - move left and right as a group, shifting forward when reaching the edge. Red-eyed ones shoot projectiles.
  - Walker class: Only move forward. Red-eyed ones shoot projectiles.
  - Laser class: Do not move, but shoot fast-moving blue projectiles.
- Mini-boss encounter (with 4 variations) on every 5th wave. You refill 2 lifes when completing the wave.

## Controls

- Move: Arrow Keys / WASD
- Rotate View: Mouse Move
